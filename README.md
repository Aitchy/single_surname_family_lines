Database &amp; web files for building Family Lines from incomplete data

My surname is restricted to two locations in the UK. But when you go beyond the start of official records and rely on patchy church records or other sources you suddenly have 50 people with the same name born around the same time.

I built a php/mysql driven website to record and deliver information on different individuals and families sharing my surname. [(See MUTCHES.COM)](http://www.mutches.com)

This was developed by me for my own use and was expanded to include files for data entry and modification in the website.

Now I want to share my files and work with others to make a generic solution that provides a tool for other single surname researchers.

**WARNING - Current files are build on the Mutch surname and are being modified to make them generic.**
